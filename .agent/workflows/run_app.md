description: Build and run the Papyrus desktop application.
---

To start the application:

1. Ensure no other instance is running.
2. Run the Gradle task:
   // turbo
   ```bash
   .\gradlew.bat run
   ```

Note: This will launch a GUI window. As an AI agent, you cannot interact with the window, but you can check the logs output in the terminal to verify startup success.
